# T1 Relaxation Time Measurement

## Executive Summary

This report documents the implementation and execution of T1 relaxation time measurements using Qiskit and quantum simulation. T1 represents the longitudinal relaxation time, measuring how quickly a qubit in the excited state |1⟩ decays to the ground state |0⟩ due to energy dissipation to the environment.

**Key Results:**
- **Expected T1**: 50.0 μs
- **Measured T1**: 52.37 ± 0.65 μs  
- **Relative Error**: 4.7%
- **Measurement Accuracy**: Excellent agreement with theoretical expectations

## 1. Theoretical Background

### 1.1 What is T1 Relaxation?

T1 relaxation, also known as **longitudinal relaxation** or **energy relaxation**, describes the exponential decay of a qubit's excited state population due to energy loss to the environment. It is one of the fundamental decoherence mechanisms in quantum systems.

### 1.2 Physical Process

When a qubit is prepared in the excited state |1⟩, it will naturally decay to the ground state |0⟩ through interaction with its environment:

```
|1⟩ → |0⟩ + ℏω₀ (energy released to environment)
```

Where:
- ℏω₀ is the energy difference between excited and ground states
- The energy is typically dissipated as heat or electromagnetic radiation

### 1.3 Mathematical Description

The population of the excited state follows an exponential decay:

```
P(|1⟩, t) = P₀ · exp(-t/T1) + P_eq
```

Where:
- **P(|1⟩, t)**: Probability of finding the qubit in |1⟩ at time t
- **P₀**: Initial excited state population (≈1 for perfect state preparation)
- **T1**: Relaxation time constant
- **P_eq**: Equilibrium excited state population (≈0 at low temperatures)
- **t**: Time elapsed since state preparation

### 1.4 Physical Significance

- **T1 = 50 μs** means that after 50 microseconds, the excited state population decreases by a factor of e ≈ 2.718
- After time **3×T1 ≈ 150 μs**, less than 5% of the original population remains in |1⟩
- Longer T1 times indicate better isolation from environmental noise
