## Experiment Overview
**Objective**: Measure unintended coupling between adjacent qubits (cross-talk errors)  
**Method**: Compare neighbor qubit states with/without target operations  
**Date**: July 25, 2025

## Key Results
| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Expected Cross-talk** | 1.2% per gate | Programmed in simulation |
| **Measured Single-Gate** | 1.29% ± 0.16% | Average across gate types |
| **Relative Error** | 7.9% | Excellent accuracy |
| **Scaling Behavior** | Linear with gate count | As theoretically expected |
| **Spatial Symmetry** | <0.1% asymmetry | Symmetric left/right coupling |

## Theory Summary
**Cross-talk Physics**: Unwanted coupling where gates on one qubit affect neighbors  
**Origins**: Capacitive coupling, control line crosstalk, frequency crowding  
**Mathematical Model**: P(N gates) = 1 - (1 - p_single)^N ≈ N × p_single  
**Impact**: Limits circuit depth, creates correlated errors, affects scalability

## Experimental Process
1. **Reference**: Measure neighbor qubits with no target operations
2. **Operations**: Apply various gates to target qubit (middle)
3. **Monitor**: Measure error rates on left/right neighbors
4. **Analysis**: Extract cross-talk = operation_error - reference_error
5. **Statistics**: Average over multiple gate types and repetitions

## Implementation Details
- **Topology**: 3-qubit chain [Q0-Q1-Q2], linear arrangement
- **Target**: Q1 (middle qubit receives operations)
- **Monitors**: Q0, Q2 (left/right neighbors)
- **Gate Types**: X, Y, Z, H, S (comprehensive set)
- **Scenarios**: 1, 5, 10 gates (scaling analysis)
- **Method**: Statistical simulation with 8,000 shots per scenario

## Key Findings

### Single-Gate Results
- **X Gate**: 1.18% cross-talk (1.6% error vs expected)
- **Y Gate**: 1.26% cross-talk (4.7% error vs expected)

- **H Gate**: 1.40% cross-talk (16.7% error vs expected)
- **S Gate**: 1.36% cross-talk (13.5% error vs expected)

### Multi-Gate Scaling
- **5 Gates**: 5.86% expected → 6.06% measured (3.5% error)
- **10 Gates**: 11.37% expected → 11.09% measured (2.4% error)
- **Linear Scaling**: Confirmed theoretical prediction P ≈ N × 1.2%
